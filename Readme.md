## Meta

### What does this script support?

Currently the only thing it does is fetch some of your ig followers, and tells you in a pretty spartan way who you're following and isn't following you back, and vice versa.

It has the option to securely save your credentials though, which can save time when running a repetitive task like this. It uses keyring, which stores credentials in your system's credential store:


- macOS Keychain
- Freedesktop Secret Service supports many DE including GNOME (requires secretstorage)
- KDE4 & KDE5 KWallet (requires dbus)
- Windows Credential Locker

### Why did I make this?

I mostly wanted to play with Python, so I grabbed a project from my running list of side project ideas and this one seemed easy.

### What's next?

I'm thinking of adding Twitter support soon. I think it would be useful to be able to delete tweets that are older than a particular date, and download them for personal archive purposes. The same could be extended to Reddit. I could also rework the current followback functionality ðŸ¤”.
